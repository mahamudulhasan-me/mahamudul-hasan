        Back in 2012, I decided to try my hand at creating custom Tumblr themes
        and tumbled head first into the rabbit hole of coding and web
        development. Fast-forward to today, and I’ve had the privilege of
        building software for an advertising agency, a start-up, a student-led
        design studio, and a huge{" "}
        <span className="hovered-text">corporation</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        My main focus these days is building products and leading projects for
        our clients at Upstatement. I most enjoy building software in the sweet
        spot where design and engineering meet — things that look good but are
        also built well under the hood. In my free time, Ive also released an
        online video course that covers everything you need to know to build a
        web app with the Spotify API.

        When I’m not at the computer, I’m usually rock climbing, reading,
        hanging out with my wife and two cats, or running around Hyrule
        searching for Korok seeds K o r o k s e e d s .
